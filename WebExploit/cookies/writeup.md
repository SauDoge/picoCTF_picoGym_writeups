# Cookies

## Given 
* A website to visit

## Process
* In the website, you can enter a cookie name to see if the name is valid. 
* Since the name of the challenge is 'Cookies', let's look at the cookie when an input is submitted. You can simply go to "Inspect" -> "Network" on the browser.
* Usually when an entry is submitted, it will trigger a HTTP request, we can look into the HTTP headers. The HTTP request should be `GET http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/check` as from the name, this should be the call that checks the validity of the cookie.
* Let's try the obviously correct one. If you enter 'snickerdoodle', the cookie header is set to 'name=0'.
* I also tried 'chocolate chip' and it worked out of pure luck. And the cookie header is set to 'name=1'. Apparently the valid cookeis will have non-negative values in their cookie header.
* Let's try a invalid cookie such as 'brrrrrrrrr'. The cookie header will be set to 'name=-1'. 

## Solution
* Now we know how the cookie header behaves when having a valid cookie. How can we know what else cookies are valid?

### Python 
* Write a script with `requests` to access the website with different cookie header.
* We select the range to be from 1 to 20.
* `requests` returns the html file in text. If we go through them one by one, we can see most of them have content like **I love xxx cookies**. But there is one special html that returns the flag under a pair of code tag.
