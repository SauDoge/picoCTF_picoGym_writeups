# Scavenger Hunt

## Given
- A website link: http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/

## Solution
* Open Page Source. There is a comment that indicates the first part of the flag in the `<div id='tababout'>`.
```Html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```
* Check the CSS file 'mycss.css'. There is comment at the bottom that indicates the second part of the flag.
```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```
* Check the JS file 'myjs.js'. There is one interesting comment.
```JavaScript
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```
* I have no idea how to do it. So let's do some Googling. [Here is where I landed](https://www.ilfusion.com/how-to-prevent-google-from-indexing-certain-web-pages). It mentions several ways to prevent Google from indexing the website. Let's check them one by one.
    * There is no 'NOINDEX' metatag in the html.
    * After checking HTTP request of the website using the Network Option in Inspector, there is also no X-Robots-Tag header.
    * Let's check if there exists a 'robots.txt' file in the server by simply appending the URL. 
    ``` URL
    http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/robots.txt
    ```
    * Here is the result. We can see the third part of the flag.
    ```HTTP
    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /index.html
    # Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
    # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
    ```
* There is another interesting comment, which could be hinting some Access files or logs we can find on Apache server.
```
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```
* Googlin 'Apache server access file' leads me to [here](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html). We can try the .htaccess file in the server.
```URL
http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/.htaccess
```
* Here is the result. We can see the fourth part of the flag. Another interesting comment about Mac and Store. 
```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```
* Googling 'MAC OS X store file' takes me to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store). Lets enter '.DS_Store' to the URL. And finally we get all the parts.
```
