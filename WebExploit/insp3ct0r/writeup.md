## Given
- https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/

## Process
* The description gives us a hint to use the inspector for this task.
* We can right click the browser and select 'inspector'

## Solution
* The flag is divided into three and are hidden in the file in terms of comment.
* The first part is in the html file
```html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```
* The second part is in the CSS file. You can view it by opening 'mycss.css' in the Style Inspector
```css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```
* The third part is in the JavaScript file. You can view it by opening 'myjs.js' under the Debugger
```js
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?2e7b23e3} */
```
* Merge the parts together and you will get the flag
